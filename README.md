# TERKUMA_GPA_CALCULATOR
Creation of a GPA Calculator using Java

Challenge

You are required to write a console application that models a Grade Point Average (GPA) calculator and prints the result.

The result should be displayed in a tabular form as shown below:

 

|----------------------------|-----------------------|------------|---------------------|

| COURSE & CODE  | COURSE UNIT  | GRADE | GRADE-UNIT |

|----------------------------|-----------------------|------------|---------------------|

| MATH 101                |   5                       |   B         |   4                    |

| GS 101                     |   3                       |   A         |   5                    |

| .NET 101                  |   5                       |   C         |   3                    |

| C# 101                      |   5                       |   B         |   4                    |

| HCI 101                    |   3                       |   A         |   5                    |

|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

 

Your GPA is = 4.10 to 2 decimal places. 

 

For reference, GPA is calculated as follows:

 

GPA = (total quality point) / (total grade unit); 

 

where :

(quality point) = (course unit) * (grade unit);

 

See grading system below: 

 

Score   Grade    Point   Remark

70-100     A           5      Excellent

60-69       B          4       Very Good

50-59       C          3       Good

45-49       D          2       Fair

40-44       E          1       Pass

0-39         F          0       Fail

 

Functional requirements

- The calculator should have a grading system that grades the score dynamically

 

Task Story

As a ** User **  

I want to be able to input course name and code, course unit, course score; one after the other 

so that the calculator will calculate the score grade and record it before the total result and GPA is displayed.

 

Acceptance criteria

- The grade should be calculated using the grading system given above

- The GPA should be calculated using the formula given above

-  Task should be submitted on or before the time allotted.

-  Task must be completed.

 

Looking forward to your submission.
